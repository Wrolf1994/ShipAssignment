Assignment Arnau Nolla

You need Unreal Engine 5.4.
In the folder ShipTest, you need to open the uproject.

After that just press the play button or alt+P and you will execute the game.

The game starts in a Start Menu, after clicking the button you go to the game itself.
Also have a pause menu that you can open with P, and you can resume game or close it.

I did a little change on the shot, you can shot with left click button as you asked, 
but you can also shot a second shot with the right button, each of them have their cooldown.
